# Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Python 🎮
This is a simple, command-line based Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python using a Jupyter Notebook. It allows two players to play against each other on a standard 3x3 grid. The game is designed to be easy to run and understand, making it a great project for beginners.

✨ Features
Two-Player Mode: Play with a friend on the same computer.

Jupyter Notebook Interface: The game is played directly within a Jupyter Notebook environment.

Input Validation: The game checks for valid moves to prevent players from selecting occupied squares or invalid inputs.

Win Condition Logic: It automatically detects when a player has won or if the game ends in a draw.

📋 Prerequisites
To run this game, you'll need to have Python 3 and Jupyter Notebook installed. A common way to get both is by installing the Anaconda distribution.

🚀 How to Run
Open the notebook: Launch Jupyter Notebook from your terminal or application launcher.

Navigate to the directory where you saved the .ipynb file and open it.

Run the cells: Execute the code cells in the notebook, following the on-screen prompts to play the game.

🕹️ How to Play
Players take turns entering the number corresponding to the square they want to mark. The board is laid out with numbers 1-9.

Player 1 uses the 'X' marker, and Player 2 uses the 'O' marker.

The game will prompt each player for their move. Enter the number in the input box and press Enter.

The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

If all nine squares are filled and no one has won, the game is a draw.

📁 File Structure
The entire game logic is contained in a single Jupyter Notebook file, which makes it simple and easy to manage.
